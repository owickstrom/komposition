# Introduction

_Komposition_ is the video editor built for screencasters. It lets you focus
on producing and publishing quality content, instead of spending all of your
time in complicated video editors. Stop wasting time on manually adjusting
clip lengths, building still-frame segments, and dragging clips around, and
enjoy a new screencast editing experience. Komposition automatically detects
scenes in screen capture video, automatically detects sentences in voice-over
audio recordings, and features a high-productivity editing workflow.

## Adjusting Your Expectations

Komposition is a young project with many of its planned features not
implemented yet. It will most likely see some bug reports, surprise you
in various ways, and be somewhat under-documented in the foreseeable future.

You, the brave early adopter, might need to lower your expectations slightly
if you're coming from Premiere Pro or Final Cut, at least in terms of software
maturity. But rest assured, Komposition is going to reward you in the long
run.
