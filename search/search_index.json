Video Assets Original video files are not copied into the project directory when imported into the library. Instead, the library only stores the file path and metadata about the original video file.

A file path resolution mechanism should be added in a future version. In addition to storing the metadata about the original file, a proxy media file is created when importing. This is lower-resolution video file that is used in scene classification, and when previewing, to improve performance and keep memory usage down. Video assets produced by the scene classifier are stored in a similar way. They consist of the original file path and the start and end timestamps of the classified scene. Audio Assets Like video assets, regular audio assets consist of a file path specifying the original audio file, and metadata. However, if you import with sentence classification, the sentences are split into new audio files stored in the project working directory.

The timeline is a tree structure, with a fixed depth, that can be described as follows: A timeline contains one or more child sequences . A sequence contains one or more child parallels , where each child is played sequentially in order. A parallel contains a video track and an audio track , where the video and audio tracks are played in parallel (simultaneously). The longest track defines the length of the parallel. Sequences Sequences are used to compose parallels that belong together, forming a cohesive part, or chapter, of your screencast. Parallels inside a sequence are played in sequence. By placing video and audio parts in separate parallels inside a sequence, you can synchronize the start of video and audio. Parallels Parallels are used to play video and audio tracks in parallel. The parts within a track play in sequence, until the end of the longest track. This means that if the audio parts form a longer track than the video parts, the video will be extended with still frames. Correspondingly, if the video track is longer, the audio track will be silent in the end. Video Audio Parts Video and audio parts added to a track are either clips from the library , or gaps . A clip is a slice of some original media file. A video gap is a still frame segment, and an audio gap is simply silence. Examples If you want video clip v1 to start at exactly the same time as audio clip a1 , put them both in the beginning of a parallel. If you want video clip v1 and audio clip a1 to play simultaneously, and when they end play video clip v2 , put v1 and a1 in one parallel followed by a parallel containing only v2 . If you want video clip v1 to play with silence, and then play audio clip a1 together with video clip v2 , put v1 in a parallel, and v2 and a1 in another parallel.

The parts within a track play in sequence, until the end of the longest track. This means that if the audio parts form a longer track than the video parts, the video will be extended with still frames. Correspondingly, if the video track is longer, the audio track will be silent in the end.","title":"Parallels"},{"location":"user-guide/concepts/timeline/#video-audio-parts","text":"Video and audio parts added to a track are either clips from the library , or gaps . A clip is a slice of some original media file. A video gap is a still frame segment, and an audio gap is simply silence.","title":"Video &amp; Audio Parts"},{"location":"user-guide/concepts/timeline/#examples","text":"If you want video clip v1 to start at exactly the same time as audio clip a1 , put them both in the beginning of a parallel. If you want video clip v1 and audio clip a1 to play simultaneously, and when they end play video clip v2 , put v1 and a1 in one parallel followed by a parallel containing only v2 . If you want video clip v1 to play with silence, and then play audio clip a1 together with video clip v2 , put v1 in a parallel, and v2 and a1 in another parallel. If you want to play video clip v1 together with audio clip a1 , but start a1 after two seconds, put v1 , a two second audio gap, and a1 in a parallel.","title":"Examples"},{"location":"user-guide/concepts/undo-redo/","text":"Undo Redo Timeline commands and asset imports can be undone and redone in Komposition.
